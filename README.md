## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* HTML, CSS
* AWS EC2
* Git & GitHub

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* To develop a web application using Express.js
* To implement user registration and login functionality
* To securely store user credentials in a database
* To authenticate users during login
* To deploy the application on an AWS EC2 instance

---

## 📂 Project Architecture

The application follows a **modular architecture**:

* **Routes** – Handle HTTP requests for registration and login
* **Controllers** – Manage application logic
* **Models** – Define user data structure
* **Database Layer** – Stores user credentials securely
* **Server Layer** – Runs the Express application

This structure improves maintainability and scalability.

## 🗄️ Database Description

The application uses **MongoDB** to store user information such as:

* Username
* Email
* Encrypted password

Passwords are securely handled to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## 🔑 Application Functionality

The web application provides the following features:

* User registration with unique credentials
* User login with authentication
* Validation for incorrect credentials
* Session-based or token-based authentication
* Secure access to protected pages after login

---

## ☁️ AWS EC2 Deployment Overview

The application is deployed on an **AWS EC2 instance**, which involves:

* Launching an EC2 instance
* Installing required software (Node.js, npm)
* Uploading application files
* Running the Express server
* Accessing the application via public IP address

This enables the application to be accessed from anywhere over the internet.

## ▶️ Application Workflow

1. User opens the web application
2. User registers with valid details
3. Credentials are stored securely in the database
4. User logs in using registered credentials
5. Server verifies user information
6. User is granted access upon successful authentication

---

## ✅ Features

* User registration and login
* Secure authentication
* Database integration
* Express.js backend
* Deployed on AWS EC2
* Scalable and production-ready setup

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Password encryption and hashing
* Email verification
* Forgot password functionality
* HTTPS configuration

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the development of a **user authentication web application using Express.js** and its deployment on an **AWS EC2 instance**. The implementation of registration and login functionality highlights core backend concepts such as routing, authentication, and database integration. Deploying the application on AWS EC2 provides hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure, making the project suitable for real-world applications and further enhancements.
